# Project: Enhanced Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

## Introduction/Background

In the 21st century, email remains a crucial communication tool, yet its utility is undermined by the inescapable challenge of spam. Our project embarks on leveraging machine learning to enhance spam detection, drawing upon the "Email Spam Detection Dataset (Classification)" from Kaggle. Similar endeavors in data-driven domains have emphasized the importance of applying analytical approaches for discerning patterns within vast datasets [1]. By applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques, this research aims to significantly improve the accuracy of spam detection [2], ensuring email remains a secure and efficient medium for digital communication [3].

## Problem Definition

Problem: 
With the increasing important of email in our daily lives for school and work, the amount of spam mail has also increased. Whether it be dangerous fishing emails or local stores trying to promote their business, people are often missing important emails in the flood of these promotions. We aim to filter out spam mail to make sure that as many important and relevant emails as possible are seen.

Motivation: 
There are several motivators to create an accurate email spam detector. Security enhancement to decrease the chances that someone can hack into personal or company data is one of many factors. Another factor is productivity improvment by spending less time looking through emails and determining if they are valuable or not.
